In Selenium, we have the WebDriver interface which have all the selenium methods.

Each driver implements the WebDriver interface and implement those abstract methods. The implementation may be different on each drivers
but the purpose of those functions are same.(Ex: getTitle(), getText(), getCurrentUrl() etc)

Different kinds of Drivers:
  1) ChromeDriver
  2) FirefoxDriver
  3) EdgeDriver etc. (safari, opera)
  
ChromeDriver: It implements the WebDriver Interface, To invoke Chrome Browser we have to use below piece of code
    
    ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();, This code will install the driver which is compatible to the current browser version
    and launch and execute. If there are restriction's in the organization to use driver version's then we have to use setProperty function.
    Before downloading the driver it will check whether we have setProperty() function, if it's there then it will simply use the driver which
    is mentioned in the setProperty(), if not then it will download it
    
    System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "location_of_the_driver_in_local")
    
 Firefox:
    FirefoxDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
    System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "location_of_the_gecko_driver")
    
 Edge:
    EdgeDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();
    System.setProperty("webdriver.edge.driver", "location_of_the_edge_driver");
