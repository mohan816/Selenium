To maximize the window: driver.manage().window().maximize()
To minimize the window: driver().manage().window().minimize()

Difference between get() and navigate().to()
   If we use get(), then it will wait for all the components to fully load in the browser, but if we navigate().to() then it
   won't wait for all the elements to fully load.
   
driver.navigate().back() -> It will go to the previous page
driver.navigate().forward() -> It will go the next page.


Example: I opened one url and then again I opened another Url on the same window. Now my control is in the new url
if I want to go the previously opened url then I have to use driver.navigate().back(). Now it will be in the first opened
url if I want to go the second opened url then I have to use driver.navigate().forward().
