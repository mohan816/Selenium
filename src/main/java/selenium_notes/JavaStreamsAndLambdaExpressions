What are Streams?
   It was introduced in Java 8, and it is used to perform aggregate operations on the data returned from the collection
   classes by drastically reduce the complexity of code.
   
What is Lambda Expression?
   Lambda expressions introduce the new arrow operator -> into java. It divides the lambda expressions in two parts
   1) The left side specifies the parameters required by the expression, which could also be empty if no parameters are required.
   2) The right side is the lambda body which specifies the actions of the lambda expressions.
   
The working of stream can be explained in three stages:
 
1) Create a Stream
2) Perform intermediate operations on the initial stream to transform into another stream
3) Perform terminal operation on the final stream to get the result.

An important characteristic of intermediate operations is laziness, When executing this code snippet nothing is printed
to the console. This is because intermediate operations will only be executed when a terminal operation is present.

Note: The aggregate operations that we perform on the collection, array that do not change the data in the source, they simply
return a new stream.
