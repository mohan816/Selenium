Eight types of Locators:

id, name, className, cssSelector, xpath, tagName, linkText, partialLinkText

Css Selector for id:
tagname#id

Css selector for class:
tagname.className

Css selector for attribute:
tagname[attribute='value']

Regular Expression css selector: We have the attribute called type and having value "pass124", next time it will chnage to
pass345. So in this case we have to use below css selector

tagname[attribute*='value']
input[type*='pass']

In xpath for tagName we use //tagName and in css simply put tagName

There is no css to identify the web elements using the visible text and also it's not possible to traverse back from child to
parent in css
