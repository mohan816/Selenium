Except static drop down's we have to handle all the dropdown's in normal like locating elements and clicking it.

Static drop-downs are with the tag Select, so we have to locate it, then create an Object for the Select class and pass
the locator to it. Then using below three methods we have to select it
  1) selectByValue() 2) selectByVisibleText() 3) selectByIndex
  
Frames: If the identified locator is correct, but we get NoSuchElementException then we have to verify that an element is 
present inside the iframe, if it's in iFrame then we have to switch to the frame and perform the action. Once the action
is done then  we have to come out of the frame.

driver.switchTo().frame(), by passing  the index or id or by locating the element.
driver.switchTo().deafultContent() -> To come out of the frame.

Windows: getWindowHandle() -> To get the current window reference, if there are multiple windows then we have to
use getWindowHandles() method.
    driver.switchTo().window(referenceId)
Set<String> windowsReference = driver.getWindowHandles();
Iterator<String> it = windowsReference.iterator();
while(it.hasNext()){
   driver.switchTo().window(it.next());
}


Links: We can identify the links using the tagName a. To open the link in new tab String click = Keys.chord(Keys.CTRL, Keys.ENTER);
driver.findElement(By.tagName("a").sendKeys(click); -> In this way we can open the link in the new tab.

To identify the header links, Locate the header WebElement, from there we can identify the links

WebElement header = driver.findElement(By.name("header"));
header.findElements(By.tagName("a")).size();


Java Script Executor: If the window is not in the visible range then we have to ask the driver to execute the java script code.
At first we have to typecast the driver to JavaScriptExecutor

JavaScriptExecutor js = (JavaScriptExecutor)driver;
To scroll down the window, then we have to use
js.executeScript("window.scrollBy(0, 500)");

To scroll down the particular WebElement, we have to locate the element and have to apply the respective functions
js.executeScript("document.querySelector('.tableFixed').scrollTop=500");
