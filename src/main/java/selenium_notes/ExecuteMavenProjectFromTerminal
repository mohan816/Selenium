1) First we required the maven surefire plugin, just browse it and add in the pom.xml
2) Usually we have multiple xml files to execute right, so what we have to do create profile and the give
   the name for it and Add the surefire plugin within it.
3) Then in the terminal, navigate to the project and execute the command mvn test -P(ProfileName), it will
   help us to execute in terminal

Set global data from Maven:

1) We read the global data from properties file right, in our framework we are getting the browser name from properties
   file instead we can set it from terminal using this command mvn test -P(ProfileName) -D(browserName)
   
   For test script to understand that we have to get the data from maven command, we have to use below piece of 
   code, EX: System.getProperty("browserName), it will help us to read the data from the terminal.
