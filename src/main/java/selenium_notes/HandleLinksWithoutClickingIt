To check whether the link is valid or broken, what actually we do, first we click on the link and get the title of the link
if title contains 404 then simply we say the link is broken, and we do the same for all the links.

Without clicking the link we can identify it whether it's valid or not by using openConnection() method of java which is 
present in URL class.

code to handle this:
   first we get all links from the DOM
   List<WebElement> links = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("li[class='gf-li'] a"));
  
   we can use SoftAssert so that even it failed it will continue to work
   SoftAssert assert = new SoftAssert();
   
   for(WebElement link: links){
      String url = link.getDOMAttribute("href");
      HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection)new URL(url).openConnection();
      conn.connect();
      int respCode = conn.getResponseCode();
      assert.assertTrue(respCode < 400, "The link with text" +link.getText()+"is broken with status code"+respCode);
   }
   assert.assertAll();
